ScorHelp
========

A little helper program for Scorcher.
Scorcher is an awesome racing simulator from Zyrinx / Scavenger team, released 1996.

This project makes it run on modern Windows (in modern resolutions, of course), fixes some nasty glitches such as read-only config files, and allows gamers to modify the game`s resources (not fully implemented yet!).
Compatible with Win32 / WINE.
